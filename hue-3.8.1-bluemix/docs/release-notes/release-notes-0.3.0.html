In this release, we have focused on ease of installation and system
compatibility. Additionally, we have included one new application, allowing the
administrator to manage users on the Hadoop cluster.</p><p>IMPORTANT UPGRADE NOTES:</p><p>After installing Cloudera Desktop 0.3.0, the first username and password you
use to log in will become your superuser account. After your first login, all
subsequent accounts will have to be created through the User Manager
application.</p><p>NEW FEATURES</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem"><p class="simpara">

Significant internal refactoring / SDK Development
</li></ul></div><p>Cloudera Desktop has undergone significant internal refactoring, working towards

Desktop Applications have been refactored to use new reusable constructs, which
we will be sharing with the community at large in the coming months.</p><p>BUG FIXES</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem">
