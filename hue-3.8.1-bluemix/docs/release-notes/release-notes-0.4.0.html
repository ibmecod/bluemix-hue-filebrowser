This release introduces the Cloudera Desktop SDK, a way to plug in your own
applications that leverage the Cloudera Desktop environment.  Another new
feature is Beeswax, a front-end application for interacting with Hive.  It also
represents many bug fixes and a re-working of the "Job Browser" and "File
Browser" applications.</p><p>NEW FEATURES</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem"><p class="simpara">

  has been fixed in release 0.4.1.
