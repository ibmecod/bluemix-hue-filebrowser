<h1>Hue Shell</h1>
<p>The Hue Shell application provides access to the Pig, HBase, and Sqoop 2
command-line shells. The Shell application is designed to have the same
look and feel as a Unix terminal. In addition to the shells configured
by default, it is possible to include almost any process that exposes a
command-line interface as an option in this Hue application.</p>
<h2>Hue Shell Installation and Configuration</h2>
<p>Hue Shell is one of the applications installed as part of Hue. For
information about installing and configuring Hue, see Hue Installation
in
<a href="http://www.cloudera.com/content/cloudera-content/cloudera-docs/CDH4/latest/CDH4-Installation-Guide/CDH4-Installation-Guide.html">http://www.cloudera.com/content/cloudera-content/cloudera-docs/CDH4/latest/CDH4-Installation-Guide/CDH4-Installation-Guide.html</a>.</p>
<h3>Unix User Accounts</h3>
<p>To properly isolate subprocesses so as to guarantee security, each Hue
user who is using the Shell subprocess must have a Unix user account.
The link between Hue users and Unix user accounts is the username, and
so every Hue user who wants to use the Shell application must have a
Unix user account with the same name on the system that runs the Hue
Server. See Unix User Accounts in

for instructions.</p>
<h2>Starting Hue Shell</h2>
<ol>
<li>Click the <strong>Shell</strong> icon (<img alt="image" src="images/icon_shell_24.png" />) in the
    navigation bar at the top of the Hue web page. (To start a second
    instance of the Shell application, right-click the link and select
    <strong>Open link in new tab</strong>.) The <strong>Shell</strong> window opens in the Hue web
    page.</li>
<li>Click any of the tabs at the top of the Shell window to open a
    subprocess shell of that type.
    <img alt="image" src="images/note.jpg" /> <strong>Note</strong>: If a button is disabled, the
    program is not on the system path. Ask your Hue administrator to fix
    this problem.</li>
<li>After opening a subprocess, click anywhere in the body of the Shell
    application window to focus the command line. (Tab-completion is not
    supported.)</li>
<li>To end a process, type exit or quit depending on the type of
    subprocess you have opened.
    <img alt="image" src="images/note.jpg" /> <strong>Note</strong>: If you close your browser, the
    underlying shell process remains running for the amount of time
    specified by your Hue administrator. After this time the process is
    killed.</li>
</ol>
