If you modified any of the thrift files you need to regenerate
the generated code by running regenerate-thrift.sh, in this
directory.  Finally, checkin any files that were generated during the previous
steps.

If you need to install the Thrift compiler, go to http://thrift.apache.org/ and
pick the version 0.7.0.
